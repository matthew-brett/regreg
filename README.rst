RegReg
======

RegReg is a simple multi-algorithm Python framework for prototyping and
solving regularized regression problems such as the LASSO. The goal is to
enable practitioners to quickly and easily experiment with a variety of
different models and choices of regularization.  In that spirit, the emphasis
is on the flexibility of the framework instead of computational speed for any
particular problem, though the speed tradeoff will generally not be too bad.
